      </p>
      <p>

        we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially
        acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised
        access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise
        that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and
        cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain

        </li>
        <li>

        <li>third parties to collect and process data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>5. International transfers of personal information</h3>
      <p>
        The personal information we collect is stored and processed in
        Netherlands, or where we or our partners, affiliates and third-party
        providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your personal
        information, you consent to the disclosure to these overseas third
        parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from countries
        in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the EEA will be
        protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data
        protection clauses approved by the European Commission, or the use of
        binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to another
        country, you acknowledge that third parties in other jurisdictions may
        not be subject to similar data protection laws to the ones in our
        jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third party engages in any act
        or practice that would contravene the data privacy laws in our
        jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able to seek
        redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Your rights and controlling your personal information</h3>
      <p>

        consent to provide the personal information to us.
      </p>
      <p>

        browser to refuse cookies from
        <a href="https://lennartemmerzaal.com/">https://lennartemmerzaal.com/</a

      <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
      <p>
        A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device
        when you visit, typically containing information about the website
        itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web
        browser when you return, additional data that serves the purpose of the
        cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track
        site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user settings (eg. timezone,
        notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg.
        advertising, language).
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as
        “first-party cookies”, and typically only track your activity on that
        particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third
        parties) are called “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you
        on other websites that use the same third-party service.
      </p>
      <h3>Types of cookies and how we use them</h3>
      <h4>Essential cookies</h4>
      <p>
        Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website, enabling
        core features like user logins, account management, shopping carts and
        payment processing. We use essential cookies to enable certain functions
        on our website.
      </p>
      <h4>Performance cookies</h4>
      <p>
        Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website
        during your visit, without collecting personal information about you.
        Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated with information
        tracked across all site users, to help companies understand visitor
        usage patterns, identify and diagnose problems or errors their users may
        encounter, and make better strategic decisions in improving their
        audience’s overall website experience. These cookies may be set by the
        website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. We use
        performance cookies on our site.
      </p>
      <h4>Functionality cookies</h4>
      <p>
        Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your
        device and any settings you may configure on the website you’re visiting
        (like language and timezone settings). With this information, websites
        can provide you with customised, enhanced or optimised content and
        services. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting
        (first-party) or by third-party service. We use functionality cookies
        for selected features on our site.
      </p>
      <h4>Targeting/advertising cookies</h4>
      <p>
        Targeting/advertising cookies are used in determining what promotional
        content is more relevant and appropriate to you and your interests.
        Websites may use them to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the
        number of times you see an advertisement. This helps companies improve
        the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content
        presented to you. These cookies may be set by the website you’re
        visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. Targeting/advertising
        cookies set by third-parties may be used to track you on other websites
        that use the same third-party service. We use targeting/advertising
        cookies on our site.
      </p>
      <h3>Third-party cookies on our site</h3>
      <p>
        We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our websites —
        for example, analytics providers and content partners. We grant these
        third parties access to selected information to perform specific tasks
        on our behalf. They may also set third-party cookies in order to deliver
        the services they are providing. Third-party cookies can be used to
        track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. As we
        have no control over third-party cookies, they are not covered by
        Lennart Emmerzaal Personal Training's cookie policy.
      </p>
      <h4>Our third-party privacy promise</h4>
      <p>
        We review the privacy policies of all our third-party providers before
        enlisting their services to ensure their practices align with ours. We
        will never knowingly include third-party services that compromise or
        violate the privacy of our users.
      </p>
      <h3>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h3>
      <p>
        If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your
        browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most browsers are configured
        to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to
        either refuse cookies altogether, or to notify you when a website is
        trying to set or update a cookie.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update
        your settings on each individual device.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your
        experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean you are unable to
        access certain features and content across the sites you visit.
